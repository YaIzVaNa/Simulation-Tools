# Simulation Tools
A compendium of different tools developed for process optimization. So far this repository includes

  - Calculate Jacobian : Input a symbolic mathematical expression, can be a list of equations. Output the Jacobian. The purpose of the script is to symbolically calculate the first order derivative of four different expressions: 
  
1. Objective function
2. Simple constraint
3. Indexed constraint
4. Indexed constraint with indexed variables

Useful for automating the generation of process constraints   which require sensitivity information.
