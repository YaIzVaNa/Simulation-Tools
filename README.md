# Simulation Tools
A compendium of different tools developed for process optimization. So far this repository includes

  - Calculate Jacobian : Input a symbolic mathematical expression, can be a list of equations. Output the Jacobian. Useful for automating the generation of process constraints   which require sensitivity information.
